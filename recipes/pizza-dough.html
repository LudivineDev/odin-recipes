    <h1>Pizza</h1>

<p><li> 500g flour </li>
<li>350g water</li>
<li>10g salt</li>
<li>1g yeast</li></p>

<p><li>500F 7mim</li>
<li>Grill broil 2/3 min</li><p>


<p>Hydrate the yeast Measure 350 grams of water at 90°F to 95°F (32°C to 35°C) into a container. Put 1 grams (½ teaspoon) of yeast in a separate, small container. Add about 3 tablespoons of the 90°F to 95°F (32°C to 35°C) water to the yeast and set aside.<p>

<p><li>Autolyse Combine the 500 grams of flour and the remaining 90°F to 95°F (32°C to 35°C) of water in a 12-quart round tub. Mix by hand just until incorporated. Cover and let rest for 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Mix Sprinkle the 10 grams of salt over the top of the dough. Stir the yeast mixture with your finger, then pour it over the dough. Use a small piece of the autolysed mixture to wipe the remaining yeast goop from its container, then throw it back in the tub.”</li></p>

<p>“Mix by hand, wetting your working hand before mixing so the dough doesn’t stick to you. (It’s fine to rewet your hand three or four times while you mix.)</p>

Reach underneath the dough and grab about one-quarter of it. Gently stretch this section of dough and fold it over the top to the other side of the dough. Repeat three more times with the remaining dough, until the salt and yeast are fully enclosed.</p>

Use the pincer method alternating with folding the dough to fully integrate the ingredients. Cut and fold, cut and fold. The target dough temperature at end the of the mix is 77°F to 78°F (25°C to 26°C).</p>

<p>Fold This dough needs one fold (see Step 3: Fold the Dough for instructions). It’s best to apply the fold 30 to 60 minutes after mixing. After folding, lightly coat the dough and the bottom of the tub with olive oil to help prevent sticking.
When the dough is about double its original volume, about 6 hours after mixing, it’s ready to be divided.

“Divide Moderately flour a work surface about 2 feet wide. With floured hands, gently ease the dough out of the tub. With your hands still floured, pick up the dough and ease it back down onto the work surface in a somewhat even shape. Dust the entire top of the dough with flour, then cut it into 5 equal-size pieces with a dough knife or plastic dough scraper. Each piece should weigh about 340 grams; you can eyeball it or use a scale. (If you plan to use any of the dough for thin-crust iron-skillet pizza or focaccia, divide that portion of the dough into 200-gram pieces.)</p>

<p>Shape the dough into balls Shape each piece of dough into a medium-tight round following these instructions, working gently and being careful not to degas the dough.</p>

<p>Refrigerate Put the dough balls on a lightly floured baking sheet, leaving space between them to allow for expansion. Lightly oil or flour the tops, cover with plastic wrap, and let rest at room temperature for 30 to 60 minutes. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to make the dough easier to shape.</p>

<p>See chapter 14 for instructions for shaping, topping, and baking pizzas. Stored in the refrigerator and tightly covered, any leftover dough will keep for up to 2 days. You may prefer the next-day dough as it develops flavors with more time in the refrigerator.<p>
