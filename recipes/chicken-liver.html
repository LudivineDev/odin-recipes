    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500g chicken livers</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp oil (for high-heat cooking, like canola)</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp butter (divided)</li>
        <li>350g sliced shallots</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper (to taste)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cognac (or brandy, port, madeira, wine, or stock)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 tsp balsamic vinegar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse, dry, and trim the chicken livers. Set a large pan over medium-high heat. Add oil and 1 Tbsp butter.</li>
        <li>Season livers with salt and pepper. Once the pan is hot, add livers and cook until golden on both sides (about 2 minutes per side). The internal temperature should reach 150Â°F (very pink inside). Remove from pan.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low. Add remaining butter and let it melt. Add shallots and salt, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Once brown bits form at the bottom of the pan, deglaze with cognac and scrape up browned bits. Continue cooking until shallots are soft and jammy (about 15-20 minutes), adding oil if the pan becomes dry.</li>
        <li>Stir in balsamic vinegar. Taste and adjust seasoning. Remove 1/3 of the shallots for garnish.</li>
        <li>Add 1/4 cup heavy cream to the pan, bring to a simmer, and scrape up browned bits.</li>
        <li>For well-done livers, return them to the pan and cook, stirring frequently, until no longer pink inside. Let cool until warm.</li>
        <li>Blend livers, shallots, and remaining 1/2 cup heavy cream in a blender or food processor until smooth.</li>
        <li>Spoon into containers and cover with plastic wrap, pressing it onto the surface, or seal with clarified butter.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate overnight. Serve with reserved shallots, crostini, fruit jam, or pickled shallots.</li>
    </ol>
