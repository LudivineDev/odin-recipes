    <h1>Hot and Sour Soup</h1>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 cups chicken broth or vegetable broth</li>
        <li>8 ounces shiitake mushrooms (or baby bella mushrooms), thinly-sliced with stems discarded</li>
        <li>1 (8-ounce) can bamboo shoots, drained (optional)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup rice vinegar, or more to taste Chinkiang vinegar or Zhenjiang vinegar </li>
        <li>1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground ginger</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili garlic sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, whisked</li>
        <li>8 ounces firm tofu, cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
        <li>4 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and white pepper (or black pepper)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Set aside ¼ cup of the chicken or vegetable broth for later use.</li>
        <li>In a large stock pot, add the remaining 7 ¾ cups of chicken or vegetable broth, mushrooms, bamboo shoots (if using), rice vinegar, soy sauce, ginger, and chili garlic sauce. Stir to combine and heat over medium-high heat until the soup reaches a simmer.</li>
        <li>While the soup is heating, whisk together the reserved ¼ cup of broth and cornstarch in a small bowl until completely smooth.</li>
        <li>Once the soup has reached a simmer, stir in the cornstarch mixture and stir for about 1 minute until the soup has thickened.</li>
        <li>Continue stirring in a circular motion, then drizzle in the whisked eggs in a thin stream (while still stirring the soup) to create egg ribbons.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tofu, half of the green onions, and sesame oil.</li>
        <li>Season the soup with salt and a pinch of white or black pepper to taste. If you’d like a more “sour” soup, add additional rice vinegar. For a spicier soup, add more chili garlic sauce.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately, garnished with the remaining green onions.</li>
    </ol>
