    <h1>Maximize Your Citrus: A Smarter, Sustainable Approach</h1>
    <img src="../images/super juice.jpg" width="300" alt="Super Juice">

    <p>Ever wondered if you could get more out of a single citrus fruit? Citrus is a staple in countless cocktails, but using an entire fruit for just one drink—and then tossing it—feels wasteful. What if there were a way to be more sustainable while also cutting costs?</p>

    <p>With the right technique, you can extract up to <strong>eight times more juice</strong> from each citrus fruit, extend its shelf life, and enhance its flavor in cocktails. It’s a win for sustainability, a win for your wallet, and a win for better-tasting drinks.</p>

    <p>This method, known as <strong>Super Juice</strong>, was pioneered by Nickle Morris, bartender and owner of Expo Cocktail Bar in Louisville, Kentucky. I’ve studied his approach, integrated insights from Dave Arnold’s acid formulas, and refined it into my own ingredient-making process. While our recipes may vary, the core principle remains the same: <strong>less waste, more flavor, and smarter bartending.</strong></p>

    <p>Ready to revolutionize the way you use citrus? It’s time for Super Juice!</p>

            <li>Malic Acid - 0.33 × weight of lime peels</li>  
            <li>Water - 16.66 × weight of lime peels</li>            
         </ul>

    <h2>Lemon Super Juice</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Organic lemon</li> 
            <li>Citric Acid - the equal weight of lemon peels</li> 
            <li>Water - 16.66x weight of lemon peels</li>  
        </ul>
    
    <h2>Orange Super Juice</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Organic Orange</li> 
            <li>Citric Acid - 0.9 × weight of orange peels</li>
            <li>Malic Acid - 0.1 × weight of orange peels</li>

    <h2>Description</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the citrus of choice, weigh the peels, and put them in a jar with the appropriate amount of citric (and malic, for lime and orange) acid. See the formula above.</li>
            <li>Shake well and leave it for up to two hours. This will create “oleo citrate,” which adds acidity and enhances the citrus flavor.</li>
            <li>Transfer everything from the jar (including the peels) into a blender.</li>
            <li>Add water (refer to the formula above). Be sure to rinse the inside of the jar with water to extract all the oleo citrate.</li>
            <li>Juice the lime, lemon, or orange and add the fresh juice into the blender.</li>
            <li>Blend for about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Strain the mixture through a cheesecloth.</li>
            <li>Bottle the Super Juice, store it in the fridge, and use it within a week.</li>
        </ol>
