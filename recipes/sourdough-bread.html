    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500g white flour</li>
        <li>350g-360g room temperature water</li>
        <li>10g salt</li>
        <li>80g sourdough starter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <p><li>Mix the water, sourdough starter, floor and salt in a bowl using the "pinch and fold" technique. Cover the bowl.</li>
        <li>Let the dough rest for 20-30 minutes for the autolyse process.</li>
        <li>Stretch and fold the dough. Apply 4 folds in total, with the first fold about 30 minutes after mixing, and the other folds every 20-30 minutes. Cover the bowl after each stretch and fold.</li>
        <li>When the dough has tripled in volume (around 5 hours), shape it into a ball and place it upside down in a banneton. Cover the banneton.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate the dough overnight.</li></p>
       
        <p><li>The next day, preheat the oven to 475°F (245°C) for 50 minutes, and remove the dough from the fridge.</li>
        <li>Once the oven is preheated, place the banneton upside down on a baking sheet and score the dough.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a Dutch oven with the lid on and bake for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>After 30 minutes, remove the lid and bake for another 20 minutes, or until the crust is medium-dark brown.</li>
        <li>Check after 10 minutes of baking uncovered in case your oven runs hot.</li></p>
    </ol>
